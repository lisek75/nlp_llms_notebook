## 📓 Quickstart Guide
Each notebook starts with a quick, friendly intro that includes:
- What it does and what problem it solves
- Models & tools used (e.g., OpenAI, LLaMA, Hugging Face, Ollama)
- Required API keys or GPU info
- Customizable parameters for easy adaptation

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lisek75/nlp_llms_notebook.git
    cd nlp_llms_notebook
    ```
2. Rename ``.the_secret_recipe`` to ``.env`` and add your API keys to unlock the magic! ✨🔑

3. Install the Conda Environment:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
    This will install all required dependencies inside the llms environment in your machine.

4. Activate the Environment
    ```sh
    conda activate llms
    ```
5. Run the Notebook
    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```
