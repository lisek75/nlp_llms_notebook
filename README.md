# üß† NLP & LLMs Notebook

## üìù Notebook Overview
This notebook is built for exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** applications. It leverages both **open-source** and **proprietary LLMs** to develop **Generative AI (GenAI) and NLP-driven solutions** across diverse fields such as **healthcare, business, finance, and human resources**.

## üìå Notebook Implemented
- Website Summarizer with OpenAI API and Llama.
- Funny Notebook where 3 AIs compete (GPT, Claude, and Gemini) and vote for their leader!
- AI-powered Brochure Generator using OpenAI API (GPT) or Ollama (llama, deepseek, qwen, mistral, ...)
- AI-driven tool that provides concise, structured explanations for technical questions and code snippets.
- Funny Notebook where three-bot chat system (GPT, Claude and Deepseek) engage in conversations with distinct personalities.
- AI agent that analyzes weather conditions and suggests activities and events based on location.


## üîë Key Features
- Real-Time Web Scraping
- Text and Document Processing
- Open-source models (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA, BERT)
- Closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5)
- Prompt Engineering
- Tools
- Gradio UI


## üìö Prerequisites
- Software:
    - Python 3.x
    - Jupyter Lab
    - Anaconda for environment management
    - Ollama for running local LLMs

- Skills:
    - Advanced knowledge in LLMs & GenAI, particularly for text-based NLP tasks
    - Familiarity with deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
    - Experience with API-based LLMs (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers)
    - Proficiency in REST API integration (endpoints and Swagger).
	

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lisek75/nlp_llms_notebook.git
    cd nlp_llms_notebook
    ```
2. Rename ``.the_secret_recipe`` to ``.env`` and add your API keys (OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Deepseek API) to unlock the magic! ‚ú®üîë

3. Install the Conda Environment:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
    This will install all required dependencies inside the llms environment.

4. Activate the Environment
    ```sh
    conda activate llms
    ```
5. Run the Notebook
    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```
